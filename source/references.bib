    abstract = { Abstract Several recent studies have utilized a Haar wavelet covariance transform to provide automated detection of the boundary layer top from lidar backscatter profiles by locating the maximum in the covariance profiles. This approach is effective where the vertical gradient in the backscatter is small within and above the boundary layer, and where the inversion is sharp and well defined. These near-ideal conditions are often not met, particularly under stable stratification where the inversion may be deep and is sometimes ill defined, and vertical gradients are common. Here the effects of vertical gradients and inversion depth on the covariance transform are examined. It is found that a significant dilation-dependent bias in the determination of the boundary layer top may result when using the published method. An alternative approach is developed utilizing multiple wavelet dilations, and is capable of identifying both the upper and lower limits of the backscatter transition zone associated with the inversion while remaining insensitive to mean vertical gradients in the background signal. This approach enables more detailed information on the small-scale structure of the inversion and entrainment zone to be retrieved than is possible using existing techniques. }
